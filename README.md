# Questions to fall in love

[Chromatone](https://chromatone.center) audio-visual web-experience for [Touch Me](https://shop.playtronica.com/products/touchme) - the tactile MIDI instrument by [Playtronica](https://playtronica.com).

## How to start

- Open any [WebMIDI enabled browser](https://caniuse.com/?search=midi) on any device
- Connect a MIDI-controller via USB, Bluetooth or DIN to the device
- OR just use your desktop keyboard
- Play notes and collect stats
- Hold any note for 3 seconds to have scene change randomly.

## What to play with

- **Swap scenes** with icon buttons to the left. Scenes change randomly after any note being held for over 3 seconds, or pressing Spacebar or Enter key.
- **Quantize notes** to 1/8, 1/16, 1/32 or free time with the bottom-left button.
- **Offset notes** by -2,-1,0,+1 or +2 octaves with a button above.
- **Change oscillator waveform** with a wave button. It will also help you shut any hang notes that may ocasionally appear.
- **Route MIDI** from inputs to outputs, both hardware or software
- **Monitor MIDI** in message log
- **Dark mode** - turn the lights on or off with a button to the top and left.
- **Stretch to fullscreen** with the toggle in the top-right corner

## How to contribute

### JS Stack

- [webmidi.js](https://webmidijs.org/docs/) provides access to MIDI
- [tone.js](https://tonejs.github.io) is used for audio synthesis and effects
- [vue 3](https://v3.vuejs.org/) the reactive components library
  - [vite](https://vitejs.dev/) - the fast build tool
  - [vueUse](https://vueuse.org) - composables to build upon
  - [unplugin-icons](https://github.com/antfu/unplugin-icons) - free svg icons to embed
    - [Ic√¥nes](https://icones.js.org/) - the free icon catalog
- [pug](https://pugjs.org/api/getting-started.html) - the neat version of HTML
- [windi css](https://windicss.org/) - the neat version of CSS

### App structure

- `public/` - the files to be copied to the root of the built site
- `src/` - the source code
  - `components/` - Vue 3 components ready to be auto-imported in any other component
  - `scenes/` - auto-parsed `vue-router` route components with `pug` flavoured svg code, that will be used inside the main `scene` svg
  - `use/` - all the composable and utility functions for the app logic
  - `app.vue` - the main scene SVG and overlays
  - `main.js` - the Vite app entry point

### How run and build the app locally

1. Clone this repo to a folder on your computer
2. Run `pnpm i` to install all project dependencies (You may need to [install pnpm](https://pnpm.io/installation) before)
3. Run the dev script with `pnpm run dev` and visit the localhost address for development and tests
4. Run the build script with `pnpm run build` and have the `dist` folder ready to upload to your static file web hosting.

### How to add scenes

1. Fork the repo
2. Create a Vue 3 component inside the `src/scenes/` folder
3. The template should contain valid SVG code to be embedded into the main scene
4. Import and use all the interfaces for MIDI, synth, colors and more from `'~/use/'` folder
5. Use present scenes as examples
6. You may use `pug` and `windicss` or prefer plain `html` templates and `css` styles
7. Add a line to the `app.vue` with Iconify icon and the scene file name like this
   `icon-ri-donut-chart-fill(v-if="scene.name == 'donut'")`
8. Push you component to your GitHub repo
9. Create a Pull Request with the changes to this repo to share it
10. We will check your code and, if everything is fine, the updated version of the experience will be deployed to the main site.
